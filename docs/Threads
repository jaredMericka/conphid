[g]Threads[/g]

Threads, in most cases, will simply consist of a hash against which posts can be made. Options are available for controlling access to threads, however. These options will need to be invoked by an administrator or moderator.

[y]Navigation[/y]
To navigate between threads, use the "[b]>go[/b]" command followed by the thread's hash (e.g., "[b]>go 0919fe44fdbbd233e5e2e8587006b7b2[/b]" will navigate to this thread). Instead of a hash, a string of characters can be used to navigate to the hash of those characters (e.g., "[b]>go threads[/b]" will navigate to this thread, too because "0919fe44fdbbd233e5e2e8587006b7b2" is the md5 hash of the string "threads").

	[c]Feed[/c] ([b](fed)[/b])
	The feed is best way to publicly expose a thread to the [g]Con(phi)[/g][g_]d[/g_] community. The feed is visible to every [g]Con(phi)[/g][g_]d[/g_] user and the "[b]>bump[/b]" command bumps the current thread to the top of the feed for everyone to see. A thread can only be bumped once every 24 hours so optimal exposure may require careful timing.

	[c]Links[/c] ([w](lnk)[/w])
	The links system allows threads to be linked together and is designed to allow easy navigation between threads with related content. A thread's links can be viewed by clicking the ([w](lnk)[/w]) tab in the panel to the top right of the main panel.

	[c]Bookmarks[/c] ([r](bkm)[/r])
	To bookmark a thread, simply run the command "[b]>bookmark[/b]" and the current thread will be added to your bookmarks. Bookmarks are accessible by clicking the ([r](bkm)[/r]) tab in the panel to the top right of the main panel. A bookmark icon will also appear beside the thread hash if you have bookmarked the current thread.

	[c]Subscriptions[/c] ([y](sub)[/y])
	You can subscribe to a thread by entering the "[b]>subscribe[/b]" command. Subscribed threads will send you a notification when new posts are made therein. If you are in a thread that you are currently subscribed to, a bell icon will appear beside the thread hash ([y](sub)[/y]).

[y]Moderators[/y]
A thread may have a moderator assigned to it to watch over the thread and make sure it continues to be useful and serve its intended purpose. In order to do this, a thread's moderator is granted special privileges that only apply inside their threads. If a thread has a moderator, the icon ((mod)) will appear beside the thread's hash. Hovering over the icon with your mouse will reveal the name of the moderator.

Moderators can only be appointed by admins but the existing moderator is able to appoint a new moderator (although doing so will relieve them of their moderator status).

[y]Locks[/y]
Threads can be locked selectively or absolutely to prevent unwanted posting or commands being run against them. Threads with any kind of restrictions will have a padlock icon beside their hash. The padlock may be open ([r](ulk)[/r]) or closed ([r](lck)[/r]) depending on whether or not your account permits posting in the thread. Below are the types of thread locks available:

	[c]Locked[/c] ([r](lck)[/r])
	Locked threads cannot be posted in by anyone except the thread's moderator.

	[c]Leveled[/c] ([y](lck) (*)n[/y])
	Leveled threads set a minimum account level required by anyone wishing to post in the thread or run commands against it.

	[c]Sealed[/c] ([b](lck) (key)[/b])
	Sealed threads can only be posted in by accounts which have posted in the thread prior to it becoming sealed.

	[c]Hidden[/c] ([r](hid)[/r])
	The hidden thread property works differently to other locks; if a thread is hidden, only users who are able to post in the thread are able to view its content.
