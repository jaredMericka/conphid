[y]What does "Conphid" mean?[/y]
Conphid doesn't mean anything. It combines a few sounds like "con" from the world "console" describing the look and feel, "phi" ((phi)); the ratio by which all the panels are sized and arranged and a "d" at the end to make it sound like a familiar word "confide".

[y]How does Con(phi)[y_]d[/y_] make money?[/y]
It doesn't. I consider the running costs of (con) to be the fee I pay for the service. Everyone else gets to use it for free. This isn't something that will change.

[y]How do I browse the threads?[/y]
You can't. The Feed ([b](fed)[/b]) is the only way to browse or to invite strangers to browse your threads. You need to come to (con) knowing what you are looking for. Hiding content in a near-endless sea of hashes is part of (con)'s security model.

[y]That doesn't seem secure at all...?[/y]
Well that's part of the experiment. Where most websites use security models that work like an armoured vault or a wall, (con)'s security model works more like home security in real life; although your most valuable possessions are probably in your home, most people never suffer a break-in because nobody knows its there and there are so many homes that nobody would know where to start looking. [r]Highly sensitive or personal information should not be stored on Con(phi)[r_]d[/r_] anyway.[/r] (con) should be used with the sensible "internet mindset" that you are posting something out to the world and that thing is written in ink.
