[y]Information Collected[/y]

(con) takes your privacy seriously. Not because good privacy is good selling point but because we genuinely have no use for any personal information about you and we don't want it. We do no market research, sell it to no third parties and have no advertising to try and target. The only information collected about you is the IP address that you make your posts from and your email address (if you voluntarily register for a level [y](*)2[/y] account). Your email address will never have anything sent to it unless:

	[c](b1)[/c] You initiate a command that sends an email to your address (e.g., "[b]>register[/b]").
	[c](b1)[/c] You opt in to email notifications for subscriptions (not yet implemented).
	[c](b1)[/c] A suspected hi-jacking of a frequently used account occurs.
	[c](b1)[/c] We are required to for some kind of legal reason (but I can't imagine what kind of reason this might be).

We won't send any updates or news to you and will never forward your email address to any third party.

[r]Private, personal or sensitive information should not be submitted to Con(phi)[r_]d[/r_].[/r]

(con) posts are stored in a secured database however (con) admins can view all posts. At this time, the administration team consists of one member. When posting on (con), always keep the following in mind:

	[c](b1)[/c] (con) should be used with the sensible "internet mindset" that you are posting something out to the world and that thing is written in ink.
	[c](b1)[/c] Thread restrictions (e.g., locks and hidden status) can be altered at any time by thread moderator. The protective measures on threads do not necessarily provide permanent protection for the thread's content. That said, moderators should be conduct themselves in a manner that shows respect for the trust invested in them by posters to their threads.
